As we age, gravity, sun exposure, and genetics take a toll on our skin, leading to wrinkles, loss of volume, and sagging. A facelift is designed to counteract these effects by tightening underlying facial muscles and redraping the skin on the face and neck. Modern techniques focus on creating a refreshed and natural appearance, not an "over-pulled" look.

Ideal candidates are men and women who are bothered by signs of facial aging but still have some skin elasticity. A facelift can address sagging in the mid-face, deep creases below the lower eyelids and along the nose, and the development of jowls.

## What a Facelift Involves

A facelift is a highly individualized procedure. The surgeon will tailor the technique to your specific needs. Incisions are typically made along the hairline and around the ear to keep scars discreet. The surgeon then lifts and repositions the deeper layers of facial tissue (the SMAS layer), removes excess skin, and closes the incisions.

Recovery from a facelift requires patience. You will experience swelling and bruising, which peak within the first few days. Most patients feel comfortable being seen in public after about two weeks, though full recovery can take several months.

Traveling for cosmetic surgery has become a common practice, with many seeking high-quality care at competitive prices.

A facelift can effectively "turn back the clock," but it doesn't stop the aging process. A healthy lifestyle and good skincare can help maintain your results for years to come.
