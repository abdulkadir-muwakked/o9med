The stigma surrounding male plastic surgery has faded, and more men are embracing cosmetic procedures to enhance their appearance and boost their confidence. The goals for male facial surgery are often different from those for women, with an emphasis on preserving masculine features while creating a refreshed and refined look.

## Most Popular Facial Procedures for Men

**1. Rhinoplasty:** Men often seek rhinoplasty to straighten a crooked bridge (often from an old injury), remove a dorsal hump, or refine the nasal tip without making the nose look overly "done" or feminine.

**2. Blepharoplasty (Eyelid Surgery):** To correct drooping upper eyelids or puffy under-eye bags, men undergo blepharoplasty to look less tired and more alert and energetic.

**3. Jawline and Chin Augmentation:** A strong, chiseled jawline is a classic masculine trait. Procedures like chin implants or jawline contouring with fillers are extremely popular for enhancing this area. Techniques like the [Texas jawline contouring procedure in Turkey](https://o9medical.com/%D8%A5%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%83-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7) are specifically designed for this purpose.

**4. Neck Lift:** A neck lift is effective for addressing a "turkey neck" or double chin, restoring a defined angle between the neck and jaw.

**5. Botox and Fillers ("Brotox"):** Non-surgical treatments are hugely popular among men. Botox is used to soften frown lines and crow's feet, while fillers can restore lost volume in the mid-face.

A surgeon experienced in male plastic surgery will understand the anatomical differences and aesthetic goals unique to men. They will aim for results that are subtle, natural, and masculine.
