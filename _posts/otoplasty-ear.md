Ears that stick out more than average or are disproportionately large can be a source of self-consciousness. Otoplasty is designed to set prominent ears back closer to the head or to reduce the size of large ears. The procedure can also correct other ear shape issues, such as "lop ear" or "shell ear."

This surgery can be performed on children once their ears have reached full size, typically around the age of five, as well as on adults of any age. The primary motivation is usually to improve psychological well-being and self-esteem.

## The Otoplasty Procedure

During otoplasty, the surgeon makes an incision on the back of the ear, exposing the ear cartilage. The cartilage is then sculpted and bent back toward the head. Permanent internal stitches are used to secure the newly shaped cartilage in place. In some cases, a piece of cartilage may be removed to create a more natural-looking fold.

After the surgery, the patient's head will be wrapped in a bulky bandage to promote healing and molding. This is typically replaced with a lighter, headband-style dressing after a few days. It's important to wear this headband, especially at night, for several weeks to protect the ears.

Specialized clinics often have extensive experience with this procedure.

The results of otoplasty are immediate and permanent. The scars are well-hidden behind the ear and are usually not noticeable.
