Rhinoplasty, or surgery to reshape the nose, is a delicate blend of art and science. It can be performed for cosmetic reasons, such as altering the size or shape of the nose, or for medical reasons, like correcting breathing problems caused by a deviated septum. The goal is to create a nose that is in harmony with the other facial features and functions properly.

Candidates for rhinoplasty should be in good general health, have realistic expectations, and be at least in their late teens, as the nose should be fully developed. The procedure involves modifying the nasal bone and cartilage to achieve the desired look.

## The Rhinoplasty Procedure

During the consultation, the surgeon will assess your facial structure, discuss your goals, and explain the potential outcomes. The surgery itself is typically performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes incisions either inside the nose (closed rhinoplasty) or across the columella, the strip of tissue between the nostrils (open rhinoplasty). Through these incisions, the bone and cartilage are reshaped.

Recovery involves wearing a nasal splint for about a week. Swelling and bruising are common but will subside over the following weeks. While initial results are visible once the splint is removed, the final, refined shape may take up to a year to fully emerge as the tissues settle.
