Botox Cosmetic is a purified protein derived from botulinum toxin that is used to temporarily relax facial muscles. When these muscles are relaxed, the overlying skin smooths out, reducing the appearance of wrinkles caused by facial expressions (dynamic wrinkles). It is most commonly used to treat lines on the forehead, between the eyebrows (glabellar lines), and around the eyes (crow's feet).

The treatment is ideal for adults who are looking for a minimally invasive way to achieve a more youthful and relaxed appearance. It's not a permanent solution, but it offers impressive results with no downtime.

## What to Expect from Botox Treatment

A Botox treatment is very quick, often taking only 10-15 minutes. A qualified practitioner uses a very fine needle to inject small amounts of Botox into specific facial muscles. The discomfort is minimal and is often compared to a pinprick.

There is no recovery time needed, and you can return to your daily activities immediately, although it's recommended to avoid strenuous exercise and rubbing the treated area for 24 hours. Results begin to appear within 3-5 days and typically last for 3-4 months. To maintain the effect, follow-up treatments are necessary.

The popularity of this treatment means it's widely available, including at top international destinations.

Botox is considered very safe when administered by a trained and experienced professional. Side effects are rare but can include temporary bruising or drooping in adjacent muscles.
