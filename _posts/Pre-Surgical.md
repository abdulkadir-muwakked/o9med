A successful plastic surgery experience begins with a thorough consultation. Being prepared with a list of questions will ensure you leave the appointment feeling informed and empowered. Here are the essential questions to ask your surgeon.

## Questions About the Surgeon and Facility

1.  **Are you board-certified in plastic surgery?** This is the most important question for verifying credentials.
2.  **How many years of experience do you have?**
3.  **How many times have you performed this specific procedure?** (e.g., rhinoplasty, facelift)
4.  **Am I a good candidate for this procedure? Why or why not?**
5.  **Where will the surgery be performed? Is the facility accredited?**

## Questions About the Procedure and Results

6.  **What surgical technique will you use for me, and why?**
7.  **Can I see before-and-after photos of patients with similar features to mine?**
8.  **What kind of results can I realistically expect?**
9.  **What are the potential risks and complications associated with this surgery?**
10. **What kind of anesthesia will be used?**

Many top clinics provide detailed information online. For example, if you are considering eyelid surgery, you can often find procedure details on sites like this one about [eyelid lift surgery in Turkey](https://o9medical.com/%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%B4%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%81%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7).

## Questions About Recovery and Cost

11. **What will my recovery period be like? How much downtime should I expect?**
12. **What post-operative care will I need? Who will provide it?**
13. **What is the total cost of the procedure (including surgeon's fees, anesthesia, and facility costs)?**
14. **What is your policy on revision surgery if the results are not what we agreed upon?**

A good surgeon will welcome your questions and provide clear, honest answers. If you feel rushed or dismissed, that is a red flag.
