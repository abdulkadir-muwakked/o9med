As we age, our faces naturally lose subcutaneous fat, leading to a loss of volume and the appearance of static wrinkles (wrinkles that are visible even when the face is at rest). Dermal fillers, most commonly made from hyaluronic acid (a substance that naturally exists in the body), are designed to address these issues.

They can be used to:

- Plump thin lips
- Enhance shallow contours like the cheeks
- Soften facial creases and wrinkles, such as nasolabial folds
- Improve the appearance of recessed scars
- Rejuvenate hands

## The Filler Injection Process

The treatment process for dermal fillers is straightforward and minimally invasive. After a consultation to determine the best type of filler and injection sites for your goals, the area is cleansed, and a topical anesthetic may be applied to ensure comfort. The filler is then strategically injected into the target areas.

The entire procedure usually takes less than an hour, and results are visible immediately. There is no significant downtime, though some temporary swelling, redness, or bruising at the injection sites is possible. The effects of hyaluronic acid fillers typically last from 6 to 18 months, depending on the product used and the area treated.
