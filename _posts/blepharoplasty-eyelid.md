Blepharoplasty is a surgical procedure aimed at improving the appearance of the eyelids. It can be performed on the upper lids, lower lids, or both. Whether you're looking to correct functional problems caused by severely sagging upper eyelids or simply wish to achieve a more youthful look, this procedure can offer significant results.

Good candidates are individuals with excess skin obscuring the natural fold of the upper eyelids, puffy "bags" under the eyes, or drooping lower eyelids. Patients should be healthy non-smokers with realistic expectations.

## The Blepharoplasty Procedure

Upper blepharoplasty involves making an incision within the natural crease of the eyelid to remove excess skin and fat. The incision is then closed with fine sutures, leaving a well-hidden scar. For lower blepharoplasty, the incision is typically made just below the lash line or on the inside of the eyelid (transconjunctival incision) to remove or reposition fat and tighten skin.

The surgery is usually done on an outpatient basis using local anesthesia with sedation. Recovery is relatively quick, with most bruising and swelling diminishing within 10 to 14 days. Cold compresses and keeping your head elevated can help manage these side effects.
