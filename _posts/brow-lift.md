A low or sagging brow can create a tired, angry, or sad expression, even when you're feeling perfectly happy. A brow lift is a surgical procedure that addresses this issue by repositioning the underlying muscles and tissues of the forehead, effectively raising the eyebrows to a more youthful position and smoothing the forehead.

A brow lift can:

- Minimize creases across the forehead and high on the bridge of the nose.
- Improve frown lines between the eyebrows.
- Raise sagging brows that are hooding the upper eyelids.

## Brow Lift Techniques

There are several techniques a surgeon can use, depending on your facial anatomy and goals:

- **Endoscopic Brow Lift:** This minimally invasive technique uses a tiny camera and special instruments inserted through small incisions hidden within the hairline. It's ideal for moderate lifting with minimal scarring.
- **Coronal Brow Lift:** This traditional method involves a long incision from ear to ear across the top of the head. It allows for significant lifting but has a longer recovery and a more visible scar.
- **Temporal or Limited Incision Brow Lift:** This involves shorter incisions in the temporal area (temples) and is often combined with eyelid surgery.

A brow lift is frequently performed in conjunction with a facelift or eyelid surgery for more comprehensive facial rejuvenation.

Recovery involves some swelling and bruising, and you may need to keep your head elevated for a few days. The final results reveal a smoother forehead and a more alert, refreshed appearance.
