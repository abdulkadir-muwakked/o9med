Chemical peels are a time-tested method for improving the appearance of the skin on the face, neck, or hands. By applying a chemical solution, the peel causes the skin to exfoliate and eventually peel off. This process reveals regenerated skin that is typically smoother, less wrinkled, and more even in tone.

## Types of Chemical Peels

Chemical peels are categorized by their depth:

1.  **Light (Superficial) Peel:** This peel removes only the outermost layer of skin (epidermis). It's used to treat fine wrinkles, acne, uneven skin tone, and dryness. It uses mild acids like alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA). You can have a light peel as often as every 2-5 weeks.
2.  **Medium Peel:** This removes skin cells from the epidermis and from portions of the upper part of the middle layer of skin (dermis). It's used to treat wrinkles, acne scars, and uneven skin tone. Glycolic or trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is often used.
3.  **Deep Peel:** This removes skin cells from the epidermis and from the mid to lower layer of the dermis. A deep peel with phenol is used for deep wrinkles, scars, or precancerous growths. It is a one-time procedure that produces dramatic results but requires a significant recovery period.

After any peel, your new skin will be temporarily more sensitive to the sun. Daily use of broad-spectrum sunscreen is crucial. The right peel for you depends on your skin type and the issues you want to address. A consultation with a dermatologist or aesthetician is the best first step.
