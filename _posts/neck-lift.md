A smooth, elegant neck is a key feature of a youthful appearance. However, due to factors like gravity, genetics, and sun damage, the neck is one of the first areas to show age. A neck lift addresses common concerns such as:

- Excess fat and skin in the lower face that creates jowls.
- Excess fatty deposits under the chin.
- Loose neck skin (often called "turkey wattle" or "turkey neck").
- Muscle banding in the neck, which creates abnormal contours.

## The Neck Lift Procedure

A neck lift can be performed in several ways. The specific technique depends on the patient's needs. A full neck lift typically involves incisions behind the ears and sometimes a small incision under the chin.

Through these incisions, the surgeon can:

- **Remove excess fat:** Often done with liposuction.
- **Tighten the platysma muscle:** The surgeon tightens and repositions the underlying neck muscles to create a smoother, more defined contour.
- **Remove excess skin:** The skin is redraped, and any excess is trimmed away.

A neck lift is very often performed as part of a full [facelift in Turkey](https://o9medical.com/%D8%AA%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%B4%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%87-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7), as rejuvenating the face without addressing the neck can lead to an unbalanced look.

Recovery involves wearing a compression garment to minimize swelling. Most patients can return to non-strenuous work within two weeks. The results are a significantly smoother, tighter neck and a more defined jawline, which can take years off one's appearance.

For those with less significant aging, non-surgical options like [filler injections in Turkey](https://o9medical.com/%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7) can sometimes be used to improve the jawline and mask early signs of jowling.
