As the face ages, it loses volume, leading to a hollowed or deflated appearance. Facial fat grafting is a procedure that restores this lost volume using your body's own fat. It is a three-step process: (1) harvesting fat from a donor area (like the abdomen or thighs) via liposuction, (2) purifying the fat, and (3) strategically injecting it into the face.

This technique can be used to:

- Restore volume to hollow cheeks and temples.
- Fill in under-eye hollows (tear troughs).
- Augment the lips and chin.
- Improve the appearance of deep facial wrinkles and scars.

## The Fat Grafting Process and Benefits

The primary advantage of fat grafting is that it uses your own tissue, eliminating the risk of allergic reaction and creating a very natural look and feel. The results can be very long-lasting, as the transferred fat cells that survive will remain permanently.

The procedure is performed under local or general anesthesia. Recovery involves swelling and bruising in both the donor and recipient sites. While some of the transferred fat will be naturally reabsorbed by the body, the surgeon will typically overfill the area slightly to compensate for this. The final, stable result is usually visible after about six months.
