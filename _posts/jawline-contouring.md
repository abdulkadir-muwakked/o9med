A weak or poorly defined jawline can result from genetics, aging, or weight gain. Jawline contouring aims to improve the shape and definition of the lower face. This can involve adding volume, reducing fat, or tightening skin to create a stronger, more sculpted look.

There are several techniques available, ranging from minimally invasive injectables to surgical implants. The right approach depends on the individual's anatomy and desired outcome.

## Methods for Jawline Contouring

**Non-Surgical Options:**

- **Dermal Fillers:** Injectable fillers (often with a higher viscosity) can be placed along the jawbone to add definition and create a sharper angle. This is a temporary but effective solution.
- **Botox:** Injecting Botox into the masseter muscles can slim the jawline, creating a more V-shaped face, particularly in individuals with a square jaw due to overdeveloped muscles.
- **Kybella:** For those with a "double chin," Kybella injections can permanently destroy fat cells under the chin to improve the jawline's appearance.

**Surgical Options:**

- **Chin Implants (Genioplasty):** A biocompatible implant can be surgically placed to augment a weak chin, which in turn improves the entire jawline.
- **Liposuction:** Submental (under the chin) liposuction can remove excess fat to reveal a more defined jawline and neck.

A popular and specific technique for jaw enhancement is known as the "Texas" method.
